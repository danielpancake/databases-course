-- 1) Find the names of courses in Computer science department which have 3 credits.
SELECT title
FROM   course
WHERE  dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'
       AND credits = 3;

-- 2) For the student with ID 12345 (or any other value), show all course_id and title of all courses registered for by the student.
SELECT c.course_id, 
       c.title 
FROM   takes t 
       INNER JOIN course c 
               ON c.course_id = t.course_id 
WHERE  t.id = '00128';

-- 3) Show the total number of credits for such courses (taken by that student).
---   Don't display the tot_creds value from the student table, you should use SQL aggregation on courses taken by the student.
SELECT Sum(c.credits) 
FROM   takes t 
       INNER JOIN course c 
               ON c.course_id = t.course_id 
WHERE  t.id = '00128';

-- 4) Display the total credits for each of the students, along with the ID of the student.
SELECT t.id, 
       Sum(c.credits) 
FROM   takes t 
       INNER JOIN course c 
               ON c.course_id = t.course_id 
GROUP  BY t.id 
ORDER  BY t.id;

-- 5) Find the names of all students who have taken any Comp. Sci. course ever.
SELECT DISTINCT s.name
FROM   student s
       INNER JOIN takes t
               ON t.id = s.id
WHERE  course_id LIKE 'CS%';

-- 6) Display the IDs of all instructors who have never taught a course.
SELECT i.id
FROM   instructor i
       LEFT JOIN teaches t
              ON i.id = t.id
WHERE  t.id IS NULL;

-- 7) Display the names of the instructors also, not just the IDs.
SELECT i.id,
       i.name
FROM   instructor i
       LEFT JOIN teaches t
              ON i.id = t.id
WHERE  t.id IS NULL;
